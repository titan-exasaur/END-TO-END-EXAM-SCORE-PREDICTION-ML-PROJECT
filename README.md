This repository contains the code for a complete machine learning project, including [data ingestion](https://github.com/titan-exasaur/MLPROJECT/blob/Main/src/components/data_ingestion.py), 
[model training](https://github.com/titan-exasaur/MLPROJECT/blob/Main/src/components/model_trainer.py), 
hyperparameter tuning, 
[prediction pipeline](https://github.com/titan-exasaur/MLPROJECT/blob/Main/src/pipeline/predict_pipeline.py), and deployment configuration.

Here's a breakdown of the project:

1. **Data Ingestion**: This part of the project focuses on bringing data into the project. It involves scripts to download or load the data from a database or file system.
2. **Model Trainer**: The model trainer is a script responsible for training the machine learning model. This script uses a machine learning library like CatBoost to train the model on the ingested data.
3. **Hyperparameter Training**: Hyperparameters are settings that control how a machine learning model is trained. This part of the project involves a script or scripts to tune these hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance on the model.
4. **Prediction Pipeline**: This pipeline automates the process of generating predictions using the trained model. It involves a script that takes new data as input and passes it through the trained model to generate predictions.
5. **Deployment Configuration**: This section provides instructions on how to deploy the project to cloud platforms like AWS or Azure App Service. This involves configuration files and scripts to set up the deployment environment.
